# GDPR Compliance Checker

## Overview
The GDPR Compliance Checker is a Python-based tool designed to automate the verification of GDPR compliance across various legal documents, including Privacy Policies, Data Processing Agreements (DPAs), and contracts. By leveraging advanced machine learning and natural language processing techniques, this tool provides a comprehensive solution for legal experts, Data Protection Officers (DPOs), and project managers to ensure compliance with GDPR regulations.

## Features
- **Automated Extraction**: Utilizes NLP techniques to extract key information from legal documents.
- **Rule-Based Compliance Checking**: Encodes GDPR requirements and validates extracted data against these rules.
- **Semantic Frame Comparison**: Compares DPA content against GDPR requirements using structured representations.
- **Knowledge Graph Integration**: Models relationships between legal documents, parties, and obligations for context-aware compliance checks.
- **Automated Workflow**: Orchestrates the compliance checking process and generates detailed reports.
- **Scheduling**: Enables automated, time-based compliance checks for ongoing monitoring.
